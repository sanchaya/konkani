    "info": "Each month, the Tiatr Academy of Goa [ http://www.tiatracademygoa.com ]  remembers the Konkani  tiatrists (stage actors) of another era, and pays tributes to them via radio on the last Saturday of each month currently (2017). This is a monthly programme broadcast on AIR FM Rainbow from Panjim, Goa.  Those remembered in this particularly (recorded) programme are Bai Rosaria Rodrigues (b. 1968), Seby Coutinho (b. 1929), Prem Kumar (d. 2007), Filomena Braz, Peter D'Costa of Colva, Star of Arossim , Khada Minguel, and the famed Remy Colaco. Bai Rosario was a child artist. Seby Coutinho was called the 'Pran' of Konkani tiatr . Prem Kumar (aka Pedro Xavier D'Costa of Chandor) was known for his innovation on the Konkani stage. He produced 55 tiatrs , and brought on the revolving stage to Konkani drama and even, at one time, managed to depict a train on stage. Filomena Braz acted in the tiatr of Alfred Rose and other greats. Braz's music can still be heard on the local radio even today. Peter D'Costa of Colva was a song writer and tiatr actor. He is known for songs like Sao Joao, Bhirmott , etc. Star of Arossim was the stage-name of Alegre Antao, who began participating in the tiatr from the age of 13 at Majorda. Arossim is a small but scenic village along the Mormugao coast. Remy Colaco is still known for his voice, and some of his plays include Satvo Sakrament (The Seventh Sacrament). He was a good writer who focussed on family themes and politics too. He was a voracious reader too. An interesting programme of talk and music. Useful to listen to spoken (Christian-dialect) Konkani, learn a bit of the language, and also familiarise yourself with the charming old world music from the region of Goa, a former Portuguese colony, capital of Lisbon's empire in the east, and now India's smallest state.",

    "info": "Konkani Hymns of Goa Revisited. Sung by the Aradhon Choir, conducted by Omar de Loiola Pereira. Presented by Funda ç ã o Oriente Museu. A live recording at the Monte Music Festival 2018, at the Chapel of Our Lady of the Mount, Old Goa, Goa, India. The programme for this concert lays emphasis on Konkani Christian music in Goa. A few hymns in other languages were also added in order to celebrate Goa's linguistic diversity. Konkani Christian music in Goa is incredibly rich,  not only in its theological content but also in its musicality. If, on the one hand, its lyrics are most often written by members of the clergy, giving these pieces significant theological substance, on the other hand, its music is composed either by priests or laymen with a significant musical background. Aradhon attempts to approach these compositions from a different angle. These hymns are sung regularly in churches across Goa and therefore their melodies are, to a large extent, left unchanged, so that the congregation can join in. A new music perspective is given by creating vocal and instrumental arrangements around the melody. In this performance: * Sam Francisku Xaviera, by Raimundo Barreto * Ekloch Amcho Somi, Vasco do Rego SJ & anon. * Ruzari Saibinni, traditional * Mari Mateak Ballok Zala, by Manohar Sardessai and Micael Martins * Onod Mhoima, by Lino de S á  and Bernardo Cota * Pie Jesu, by A L Webber * Devacho Sobd Tum, by Lino de S á  and Bernardo Cota * O Santissima, traditional * Panis Angelicus, by Cesar Franck * Tujea Hatant Mhozo Hat, by Vasco do Rego SJ and Tom á s d'Aquino Sequeira * Dev Zata Monxeachem Khann, by Vasco do Rego SJ & Alc á ntara Barros * Sangatam Cholum-ia, by Tom á s d'Aquino Sequeira * Maie Kakutin Bhorlole, traditional * An Irish Blessing, by Bob Chilcott * O Happy Day, Gospel Music Standard Credits:  * Omar de Loiola Pereira, musical director, guitarist and baritone * Fleur Anne Dias, soprano * Anushka Coutinho, soprano * Efigenia de Santana Miranda, soprano * Heidi Loiola Pereira, alto * Nisha Carvalho Costa, alto * Ravi Carvalho, tenor * Dylan Carvalho, tenor * Gino Collaco, tenor and keyboard",
